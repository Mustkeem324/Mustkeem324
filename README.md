# 1. 👨‍💻 About Me

I am **Mustkeem Ahmad**, a backend-focused engineer and founder of  
**Freelancekar**, an automation-first engineering studio.

My journey started in **Electrical Engineering**, where I learned:
- Discipline
- System safety
- Reliability
- Real-world consequences of failure

I later transitioned into **software engineering**, bringing with me
a strong systems mindset.

I don’t treat software as “code only”.  
I treat it as **infrastructure**.
